		Set in the year 0 F.E. ("Foundation Era"), The Psychohistorians opens on Trantor, the capital of the 
		12,000-year-old Galactic Empire. Though the empire appears stable and powerful, it is slowly decaying
		in ways that parallel the decline of the Western Roman Empire. Hari Seldon, a mathematician and 
		psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that equates all 
		possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing for the prediction of future events.
